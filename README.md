## 📖 Overview

Cutline OS is an enterprise-grade business management system designed specifically for creative professionals—designers, photographers, video editors, and agencies. It bridges the gap between creative workflows and business administration by providing a unified platform for project pipelining, client CRM, financial management, and asset tracking.

The architecture emphasizes strict data isolation (multi-tenancy), rigorous performance optimizations, and a premium, accessible user interface inspired by industry leaders like Linear and Stripe.

## 🏗 Architecture & Tech Stack

The application is built as a Modular Monolith, leveraging Server Components and Edge Middleware for security and performance.

| Domain | Technology | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) | App Router architecture utilizing React Server Components (RSC) and Server Actions. |
| **Language** | [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | Strict type safety across the entire stack, from database schema to UI components. |
| **Database** | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | Hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/) (with [Aiven](https://aiven.io/) as a redundancy fallback). |
| **ORM** | [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) | Schema management, migrations, and direct database querying (with Prisma Accelerate as an edge-caching backup). |
| **Auth & Identity** | [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) | B2B multi-tenant organization management and secure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). |
| **Styling & UI** | [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) | Utility-first styling paired with unstyled [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) primitives. |
| **Email Delivery** | [Resend](https://resend.com/) | Transactional email delivery via React-based email templates (`@react-email`). |

### Core Architectural Decisions

- **Strict Multi-Tenancy:** Data is rigidly partitioned using `businessId` at the database level. Server-side data access layers actively assert the active tenant ID before executing queries.
- **Financial Precision:** All monetary values are strictly stored as `Int` (cents/minor units) to eliminate floating-point arithmetic errors.
- **Webhook Synchronization:** Real-time data synchronization between the authentication provider (Clerk) and the PostgreSQL database using Svix webhooks.
- **Edge Routing Security:** Next.js Middleware acts as the first line of defense, validating authentication states and RBAC claims before rendering layouts.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Tenant CRM & Access Control
- Isolated business environments utilizing Clerk Organizations.
- Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) separating `org:admin` (Full access) from `org:member` (Pipeline-only read access).
- Smart client directory with sequential ID generation (`CL-XXX`) and dynamic 5-star rating algorithms for sorting high-value accounts.

### 2. Intelligent Financial Engine
- End-to-end invoice lifecycle management (Draft, Sent, Partially Paid, Paid, Void).
- Automatic cost-allocation for business assets linked to projects.
- Client-side and server-side PDF generation featuring multi-currency support and exact payment timestamps.
- Public, client-facing payment portals (`/invoices/[id]/pay`) to streamline receivables.

### 3. Project & Pipeline Workflow
- Interactive Drag-and-Drop Kanban boards with customizable stage progression.
- Built-in time tracking, deadline indicators, and client feedback integration.
- Automated creation of pipeline projects via external Client Intake Forms.

### 4. Advanced Analytics & Dashboarding
- Real-time aggregation of MTD Revenue, Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), and Overdue ledgers.
- Interactive data visualizations utilizing Recharts.
- Unified notification hub for tracking unread alerts and workflow updates.
- Instantly exportable CSV reporting for external accounting integrations.

### 5. Internal Team Messaging
- **Direct & Group Chats:** Seamlessly communicate with team members in 1-on-1 direct messages or multi-participant group chats.
- **Admin Broadcasts:** Dedicated announcement channels where admins can blast updates to the entire organization (read-only for members).
- **Smart Chat Management:** Features include mute notifications, soft-deletion for members (hides history until new message), and hard-deletion capabilities for admins.

## ⚡ Performance & Benchmarks

Performance is treated as a core feature. We rely on React Server Components to offload computational weight from the client, ensuring near-instant page transitions even with dense data tables.

**Optimizations Include:**
- Direct database connection polling (with Prisma Accelerate maintained as an optional backup caching layer).
- Optimistic UI updates during drag-and-drop operations.
- Server-side JWT decryption to prevent blocking network requests to the Auth provider.

## ⚙️ Local Development Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- A PostgreSQL Database instance (e.g., Neon or Aiven)
- Clerk Application keys
- Resend API key

### 1. Repository Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heisenberg-611/Cutline_Business_manager.git
cd Cutline_Business_manager
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on the required secrets:

```env
# Database Connection
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require"
# Optional backup Prisma Accelerate connection
# DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require"

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."

# Routing Defaults
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL="/dashboard"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL="/dashboard"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_OUT_URL="/sign-in"

# Resend Mailer
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
```

### 3. Database Initialization

```bash
# Push the schema and apply migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# (Optional) Seed the database for testing
npm run seed
```

*Note: You must route Clerk webhooks locally to sync Organization data. Use the [Svix CLI](https://docs.svix.com/cli):*
```bash
svix listen http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/clerk
```

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
