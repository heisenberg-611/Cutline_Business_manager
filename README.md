## 🏗️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following API keys and services to run this app locally:
- **Aiven / PostgreSQL**: A valid Postgres database connection string.
- **Clerk**: Publishable key, Secret key, and Webhook secret.
- **Resend**: API key for transactional emails.

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your keys:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/defaultdb?sslmode=require"

# Clerk Auth
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

# Clerk Redirects
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/dashboard/select-business"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/dashboard/select-business"

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Resend Emails
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup the Database

Push the Prisma schema to your database to create the necessary tables:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

*Note: The system requires Clerk webhooks to sync Business and User data into the database. You must use `svix` or a similar tool to forward webhooks to `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/clerk` during local development.*

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
