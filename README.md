## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm/yarn
- **PostgreSQL Database**: [Aiven](https://aiven.io/) or any PostgreSQL provider
- **Clerk Account**: For authentication and webhooks
- **Resend API Key**: For transactional emails

### Step 1: Clone & Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/heisenberg-611/Cutline_Business_manager.git
cd Cutline_Business_manager

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# 🔒 Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=require"

# 🔑 Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

# 🔗 Clerk Redirect URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/dashboard/select-business"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/dashboard/select-business"

# 🌐 Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# 📧 Resend Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
```

### Step 3: Database Setup

Initialize your database schema:

```bash
# Create database tables
npx prisma migrate dev

# Or push schema directly
npx prisma db push

# (Optional) Seed with demo data
npm run seed
```

**Note**: Clerk webhooks are required to sync Business and User data. During local development, use [Svix CLI](https://docs.svix.com/cli) to forward webhooks:

```bash
svix listen http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/clerk
```

### Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 📦 Database Seeding

Quickly populate your database with realistic demo data:

```bash
# Seed with demo data (4 clients, 4 projects, 5 invoices, etc.)
npm run seed

# Reset database and start fresh
npm run reset-db

# Reset and reseed
npm run reset-db && npm run seed
```

See [scripts/SEED_README.md](scripts/SEED_README.md) for detailed seeding documentation.

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev           # Start dev server with Webpack

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start            # Run production build

# Database
npm run seed         # Seed database with demo data
npm run reset-db     # Clear all data from database

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building Cutline OS has been an incredible journey. Here are some of the key technical takeaways from this project:

- **Next.js App Router & Server Actions**: Deepened my understanding of React server components, data fetching, and handling secure database mutations efficiently.
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Learned how to architect a robust multi-tenant system, partitioning data securely using Clerk Organizations and Prisma (`businessId`).
- **Webhook Synchronization**: Implemented real-time data syncing between Clerk (Authentication) and the PostgreSQL database using Svix.
- **Premium UI & Interactions**: Mastered crafting a professional, high-performance interface using Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, and implementing complex interactions like the global command palette (Cmd+K) and drag-and-drop Kanban boards.
- **PDF Generation & Email Delivery**: Gained hands-on experience generating dynamic PDF invoices and designing React-based transactional emails with Resend.
