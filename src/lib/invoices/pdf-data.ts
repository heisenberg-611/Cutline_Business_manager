/**
 * Maps raw Prisma Invoice data → the exact InvoiceData shape expected by
 * the InvoiceTemplate PDF component.
 *
 * Architecture decisions:
 * - Uses findFirst + businessId filter (not findUnique) to enforce multi-tenancy.
 *   This prevents IDOR: a user in Org A can never fetch Org B's invoice,
 *   even if they somehow obtain the invoiceId.
 * - Money values stay as integer cents — the template handles /100 formatting.
 * - Graceful fallbacks for optional fields (email, address) so the PDF
 *   never renders "undefined".
